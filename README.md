# CSC377-Final-Project-Horror-Game
VR Horror Game Created with Unity for Cal Poly CSC 377: Mixed Reality

If you want to mess around with the Unity Project, I recommend turning off Fog in Window->Rendering->Lighting->Scroll to Other Settings-> Uncheck Fog. Also I have a directional light called "TempLight" that is disabled for the game build, but it's helpful for seeing stuff in the scene window.
