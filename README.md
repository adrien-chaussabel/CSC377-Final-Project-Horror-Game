# CSC377-Final-Project-Horror-Game
VR Horror Game Created with Unity for Cal Poly CSC 377: Mixed Reality

### Play the Game
To play the final game build, all you need is the GameExecutable folder. Run FinalProject.exe to launch the game. Controls are for Oculus Touch controllers, and you may need to add custom bindings for other headsets/controller setups.

### See the Game Source
If you want to mess around with the Unity Project, open the "Final Project" directory in Unity (2019.4 LTS). I recommend turning off Fog in Window->Rendering->Lighting->Scroll to Other Settings-> Uncheck Fog. Also I have a directional light called "TempLight" that is disabled for the game build, but it's helpful for seeing stuff in the scene window.
